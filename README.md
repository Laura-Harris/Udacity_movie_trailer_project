# Udacity_movie_trailer_project

Udacity's first project for the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) 

## About

This project shows a list of movies that each contain a link to view its trailer in a modal window. 

`media.py` creates Python classes to be used when creating instances of the each Movie object. A Parent class (Video) is used with the Child class (Movie) to allow for the reuse of variables in multiple child classes if more child classes are created. 

## Quick Start

* Install Python (Version 2.7.14)
* Clone this repository
* In a terminal window navigate to the project directory
* Run the code `python entertainment_center.py`
* Fresh Tomatoes will open in your web browser and display the movie list
